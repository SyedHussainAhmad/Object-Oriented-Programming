# Object-Oriented Programming in C++

A curated collection of C++ projects designed to teach and demonstrate essential OOP concepts—created and maintained by **Syed Hussain Ahmad**, also used to support junior students in my role as a teaching assistant.

## 🎓 About

As a TA for the OOP course, I guided juniors through hands‑on coding challenges there is a folder Named OOP F23 (Taship). This repository features curated examples that simplify key concepts such as classes, inheritance, and polymorphism—designed for clarity, engagement, and real-world relevance.

## Concepts Covered

### 1. Classes & Objects  
Demonstrates how to define classes, instantiate objects, and use constructors/destructors and member methods to model real‑world entities.

### 2. Encapsulation  
Illustrates data hiding by using access specifiers (`private`, `public`, `protected`) to protect internal state and expose only safe, controlled interfaces.

### 3. Inheritance  
Shows how derived classes extend base classes, reusing code and creating hierarchical relationships to promote design clarity and reduce duplication.

### 4. Polymorphism  
Covers both compile‑time (function overloading, templates) and runtime (virtual functions) polymorphism, enabling the same interface to work with different underlying types.

### 5. Abstraction  
Uses abstract base classes or interfaces with pure virtual methods to define contracts for derived classes, enforcing consistent behavior across implementations.

### 6. Templates  
Explores generic programming with function and class templates, allowing code to operate on multiple types without sacrificing type safety.

### 7. Exception Handling  
Implements robust error detection and recovery using `try`/`catch` blocks and custom exception types to manage runtime failures gracefully.

## TA Assist Mode

When teaching:
- I led weekly lab sessions.
- Walked students through live coding examples.
- Held office hours to debug and discuss best practices in design.
- Used these projects as step-by-step practice materials.

Your peers can clone this repo and walk through problems incrementally—just like in class.
